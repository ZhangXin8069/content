The external package to use the chroma.

My Makefile is pushed as example, but please don't push your local version
of the Makefile to the git.

To use it with Huey-Wen's branch, please change the Makefile to enable 
the -D_PDF_ flag. 

The XML element pion_DA can only be used with Huey-Wen's branch at present
since it used some features only in that brach.


TODO list:

The present grid source can not use most of the contraction element since
Chroma will check the source type. 

We should have a XML element to read the propagator in the KYU format.
